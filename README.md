OCTOBER/2019

## Introduction

The 42 C Piscine is a bootcamp in which you learn to program in C from scratch.
No prior knowledge is required, all you need is a lot of commitment and will power.
At the end of the the non-stop 26-day program you will have acquired skills not only in Shell and C Language, but also in teamwork and community collaboration.

## Tools and technologies

 - **Shell**: command line interface with the basics of Unix and bash scripts
 - **C Language**: arrays, pointers, dynamic memory allocation, file manipulation, libraries use and implementation, Makefile, linked list and binary trees.
 - **Git**: Use of Git version-control system to submit the lists repositories

## Lists

### Usage

```bash
$ gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra *.c && ./a.out
```

*Disclaimer: I've fixed a lot of the exercises, and made new solutions to previous ones that I didn't completed during the piscine.*
